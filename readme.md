# About Me  - Prep Assignment

## Objective
This is a project for [AcceleratedHK](https://www.acceleratedhk.com/) as a prep assignment in this stage and it is intended to be my profile website in the future.

## Web Content
The current web page is a standalone one-page HTML which is divided into four parts, including 

* welcome section

* personal information section(personal info, hobbies, dreams)

* porfolio section

* contact me section

## Stack used
 
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * jQuery
 * Bootstrap 3

## Implementation
 
### Basic Layout

In order to practice my skills, I didn't use bootstrap's grid system for mobile responsive as the backbone structure. Instead I am using flexbox and basic html and css to accomplish the task. Beside, I decide to not including any external javascript library and build the animation by using jquery myself. 

### Welcome Section

In order to keep the website clean and neat, I pick a watercolor background and a statement with fadeIn animation

### Personal Information Section

To make a carousel liked effect, I use css overflow and some other properties to make my section neat without having to show all the content at the same time.

### Porfolio Section

I try to use cards effect made by css to display my porfolios. With cards, I can show photos of my projects as well as the details with a click. In order to not overwhelming visitors, I also use carousel to show three projects at a time and one when the user are using mobile device.

### Contact Section

Visitor can find my contacts through clicks on logos of facebook, gmail and github.
